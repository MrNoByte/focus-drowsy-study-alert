# Focus-Drowsy Study-Alert

This project is can be divided into two parts:
    **1. Drowsiness detection:** Using computer vision and object detection techniques
        Most probably, using YOLO-v8 for detecting drowsiness.
    **2. Alerting user:** In this phase we will create some sort of way to alert user when s/he is sleepy.
